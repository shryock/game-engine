    <h1 class="heading">About our project</h1>
    <div class="descriptive-text">
        Created by Andrew Shryock, Chris Miller, Colleen Britt, and John-Michael Caskey as part of a semester-long project for 
        NC State's CSC481 Game Engine Foundations course.
    </div>

    <h2 class="heading">Getting Started</h2>
    <div class="descriptive-text">
        To start using our engine for development of your own game, take a look at our examples! The game engine is initialized by calling 
        the startGame function in engine.js. This function requires the specification of a game class. Any newly created game classes must 
        contain createGame, update, and draw functions at a minimum. Within your game codes, utilize the GameObject class to make the most 
        of the engine's functionality.<br/><br/>

        To include the engine in your project, download the necessary components and include the engine files (engine.js, Assets.js, 
        storage.js, ui-components.js, particle-system.js, and collision-system.js) in your main HTML file. From there, all you have to do 
        is setup your HTML canvas and initialize the engine. An example of the latter step can be found in gallery.js.<br/><br/>

    </div>

    <h2 class="heading">The Engine</h2>
    <div class="descriptive-text">This engine was constructed based on what game developers will need to create their 2D games. It is important that games have basic functionality, such as updating the game to reflect the user's input and managing all of the game objects, both active and in
    active. It wouldn't be a game without a collision system, and a good particle system makes the games more interesting. The following describes how each part of the engine functions. </div>
    <div>
        <h3 class="heading">Game Loop and GameObject Definition</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                The game engine is essentially an infinite loop that is broken down into two components: 
                Update and Draw. The game loop is initialized by calling the startGame() function. This 
                will setup and interval to call the game loop at a passed-in speed. From there, the engine 
                will automatically update and draw all registered game elements. This is done through the 
                GameObject class. Every piece of your game that you want to see or interact with should 
                inherit the GameObject class. The GameObject class provides standard ways to register 
                sprites and set them as visible or collidable, for example.
            </div>
        <h3 class="heading">User Input</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                The game engine provides basic functionality for accepting user input from both the 
                keyboard and mouse. Set the draggable property of any GameObject to make it moveable 
                by clicking and dragging the mouse. Call the isKeyDown function to query the game engine 
                for the current status of any key. This function utilizes keycodes and provides a series 
                of shortcuts ("left", "right", "space", etc.) for commonly used keys, rathering than 
                having to remember the keycode. The engine supports the ability to hold down multiple 
                at any given time.
            </div>
        <h3 class="heading">Asset Management System</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                Asset creation, maintenance, deletion is handled by the engine. Many of the game objects 
                inherit properites, and functions for a Game Object Prototype before defining game specific 
                characteristics. Assets system is design for easy retrival of objects allowing for search 
                and retrieval of objects by name. Linking sprites to objects has been abstracted so that 
                single frame sprites and animating sprite sheets are accepted and can be added at the 
                engine level through a set of functions.
            </div>
        <h3 class="heading">Particle System</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                The engine deploys a particle system design to maintain, create, update and destroy 
                particles in game. The particle system allows for emitting particles in regions defined at 
                system initialization. Emission characteristics are definable allowing for toggleable 
                emission, variable rate, and finite or infinite emission. Referencing global 
                characteristics such as particle list and count are available via function call.
            </div>
        <h3 class="heading">Physics</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                The game engine supports a rigid-body collision system. This is completed using a QuadTree 
                data structure and Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes for all GameObjects with sprites. In order 
                to utilize the collision system, simply register any GameObject with a sprite with the 
                collision system by setting the GameObject's collidability field to true using the setter. 
                This will then ensure that the GameObject is added to the QuadTree on each update. From 
                there, use the checkCollision() function to query the collision system for a specific 
                collision between two GameObjects. The QuadTree data structure serves as a broad-phase 
                collision detection algorithm, which greatly reduces the total number of collision checks 
                per tick, since only GameObjects that are close to each other are checked for collisions.
            </div>
        <h3 class="heading">Local Storage System</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                Local storage functionality has been added and can be accessed using a defined storage 
                object. Storage object contains functions for retrieving objects by name such as persistent 
                stats between game sittings i.e. score.
            </div>
        <h3 class="heading">UI Componenets Library</h3>
            <div class="descriptive-text">
                The game engine comes with a UI Components library for common game UI elements including 
                score, high score, boxes, and alerts. The library is easily extendable to add additional 
                HTML canvas-based common UI components for any game. Use the public functions associated 
                with the UIComponents class to use this functionality.
            </div>
    </div>
    <h2 class="heading">The Games</h2>
    <div>
        <div>The games created showcase the different aspects of the engine. They may look simple,
        but, underneath the surface, they are complex. However, the engine will make it easy for game developers to create their games. They would only need to worry about their game's logic. From collision and asset systems to impressive AI capabilites, this engine will allow game developers to create fantastic 2D games.The following describes the games and how to play them, so everyone can test the engine while having fun.</div>
        <h3 class="heading">Alchemy</h3>
        	<div class="controls"> Controls: <ul><li>Click and drag the elements to combine</li></ul></div>
            <div>Alchemy puts a fresh and colorful spin on the classic game of combining elements! <br/>
            Click and drag the elements out of the box. Once they collide, a new color will be created. <br/>
            Can you find all eleven colors?</div>
        <h3 class="heading">Snake</h3>
        	<div class="controls"> Controls:
