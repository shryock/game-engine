README - Cops and Robbers

The game allows for a player to play as a cop, robber, or spectator. The player movement levels are a little buggy, so we recommend trying the spectator mode to see the path-finding algorithm do its magic. There are a few times when the algorithm messes up and gets stuck, but we didn't have time to fix that. We assume it is due to some tiles being permenantly set to 'occupied'. If that happens, you can either wait for the robbers to win, or refresh the page. 

There are currently 3 maps that are randomly picked. Each have their own quirks. The first has plenty of dead ends to help the cops win. The second has no dead ends and many loops, allowing for the robbers to evade the cops. The last level is an empty box, allowing the cops to show off the power of teamwork.
